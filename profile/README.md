# McBethLab: Advancing AI in Radiation Oncology

Welcome to the McBethLab GitHub repository! Our lab, based at the University of Pennsylvania, focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, medical physics, and radiation oncology. We develop AI-driven solutions to improve clinical workflows, automate treatment planning, and enhance patient outcomes in radiation therapy.

## Research Areas

### 1. AI-Driven Radiation Treatment Planning
We are developing automated treatment planning solutions to optimize plan quality while reducing clinical workload. Our work includes:
- AI-based contouring and segmentation models
- Automated radiation dose optimization
- Uncertainty quantification for AI-generated plans

### 2. Large Language Models (LLMs) for Clinical Decision Support
We explore applications of LLMs in medical physics and radiation oncology, such as:
- AI-assisted medical documentation
- Explainable AI for decision-making
- AI-enhanced education and training for clinicians

### 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Therapy
Our lab is investigating reinforcement learning strategies to dynamically adjust radiation treatment plans based on patient-specific responses.

### 4. AI Ethics and Explainability in Clinical AI
We emphasize model transparency, interpretability, and regulatory considerations for AI deployment in medicine. Our goals include:
- Bias mitigation in AI-driven clinical workflows
- Development of human-in-the-loop AI systems
- Implementation of AI safety and fairness protocols

## Current Projects

- **Automated AI Contouring for Pediatric Proton Therapy**: Evaluating AI-generated segmentations with clinical experts to assess accuracy and usability.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Segmentation Models**: Integrating uncertainty overlays into segmentation maps for better clinician confidence and quality assurance.
- **LLM-Assisted Radiation Oncology Documentation**: Deploying large language models to streamline treatment documentation and workflow optimization.
- **Multi-Institutional AI Validation**: Assessing model generalizability across different hospitals and clinical settings.
